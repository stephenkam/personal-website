   <p align="justify"><font color="black">Hi! I am Stephen. I have hybrid experiences in system implementation and account / treasury operations. I received 2 Bachelor degrees, one in Accounting and the other in Computing.  
     Synergies of these 2 mindsets are demonstrated in my proven exposure in ERP admin, requirement analysis and project management in systems such as ERP, HR, CRM, Treasury, SharePoint and Payment Gateway.
